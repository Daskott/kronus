# Kronus
A CLI App to help you stay in touch with your contacts, as well as yourself ðŸ™ƒ. The two main features/cmd:
- `touchbase` 
  - create recurring google events as a reminder to reach out to contacts
  - You can create `touchbase` events for contacts in any group, up to a Max of **7** contacts.
- `server` 
  - enables liveliness probe for users on the server. It's still in pre-alpha, so a lot can change about it's implementation & features
  - [See doc](Server.md) if you want to test out this feature.

```
kronus is a CLI library for Go that allows you to create
appointments to check in with your contacts and also yourself(i.e liveliness probe).

To keep in touch with contacts, kronus enables you to generate recurring google calender events for each of your contacts,
to remind you to reach out and see how they are doing.

And to checkup on yourself, kronus allows you to schedule a liveliness probe that sends out a message to you every week
via kronus server.

Usage:
  kronus [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  server      Start a kronus server (pre-alpha)
  touchbase   Deletes previous touchbase events and creates new ones based on configs

Flags:
      --dev       run in development mode
  -h, --help      help for kronus
      --test      run in test mode
  -t, --toggle    Help message for toggle
  -v, --version   version for kronus

Use "kronus [command] --help" for more information about a command.
  ```

## Pre-requisite for touchbase cmd
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Create a google cloud project with permission to access google calendar. [See docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
- Create a service account to use with app. [See docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
- Share your calendar with the service account email. Change the permission settings to `'Make changes to events'`. Save Changes.
- Make sure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set in the environment you run `kronus`(or update `$HOME/.kronus.yaml` accordingly - see below). E.g:
  ```
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/service-account-file.json"
  ```

## How to use it
- Install:
  ```
  go get -u github.com/Daskott/kronus
  ```
- Run `kronus touchbase --group=<group_name>` to create re-curring event on google calendar
- For help run `kronus touchbase --help`
  ```
  Deletes previous touchbase google calender events created by kronus
  and creates new ones(up to a max of 7 contacts for a group) to match the values set in .kronus.yaml

  Usage:
    kronus touchbase [flags]

  Flags:
        --config string      config file (default is $HOME/.kronus.yaml)
    -c, --count int          how many times you want to touchbase with members of a group (default 4)
    -f, --freq int           how often you want to touchbase i.e. 0 - weekly, 1 - bi-weekly, or 2 - monthly (default 1)
    -g, --group string       group to create touchbase events for
    -h, --help               help for touchbase
    -t, --time-slot string   time slot in the day allocated for touching base (default "18:00-18:30")

  Global Flags:
        --dev    run in development mode
        --test   run in test mode
  ```

## Configuration for `touchbase` cmd
The config file is created in `$HOME/.kronus.yaml` if you've run the App at least once.

You can also create the config file manually in the default path if you choose. Or a new path & tell `kronus` where to find it using the `--config` flag.

Update config to include your `timezone`, `contacts` & `groups`. 
  ```yml
  settings:
    # Update the timezone to match yours e.g.
    # America/New_York
    # America/Vancouver
    # America/Los_Angeles
    # Go to http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/findzone to see others.
    timezone: "America/Toronto"
    
    # Leave as is, to avoid unexpected behaviour. 
    touchbase-recurrence: "RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;"

  # Here you update your contact list with their names.
  # e.g.
  contacts:
    - name: Smally
    - name: Dad

  # Here you add the different groups you'd like to have for your
  # contacts. And populate each group with 
  # each contact's id(i.e. index of their record in contacts)
  # e.g. 
  groups:
    friends:
      - 0
      - 1
    family:
      - 0

  # This section is automatically updated by the CLI App to manage
  # events created by kronus
  events:

  owner:
    email: <The email associated with your google calendar>
  
  # For API secrets. This is mostly for convienece. In a production environment, pass GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS directly into the env and kronus will override whatever is in here.
  secrets:
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: <Path to the JSON file that contains your service account key>
  ```
