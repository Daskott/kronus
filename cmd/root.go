		Short: `kronus is a CLI library for Go that allows you to create
appointments to check in with your contacts and also yourself(i.e a liveliness probe).

To keep in touch with contacts, kronus enables you to generate recurring google calender events for each of your contacts,
to remind you to reach out and see how they are doing.

And to checkup on yourself, kronus allows you to schedule a liveliness probe that sends out a message to you every week
via the kronus server.`,
